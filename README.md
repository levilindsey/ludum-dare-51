## ‍👨‍💻 The jam

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/) is a semi-annual event where people create a game over the weekend.
-   It is a ranked competition, with a clever voting system that gets more eyes on your game when you in turn rate other games.
-   There are a few different tracks you can participate in; I usually do the more-challenging "**Compo**" track, where you must create all your own art, music, sounds, etc. from scratch, work by yourself, and finish within **48 hours**.
-   The games all follow some central theme, which is only announced at the start of the jam.

I worked solo and created everything during the event (the Compo track). Except of course for my frameworks (which is fine, you're allowed to use pre-existing code).


### 💡 The theme

"Every 10 seconds"
